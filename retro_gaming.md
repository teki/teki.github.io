SBC - Single Board Computer

Originally it was about building retro game consoles out of cheap SBCs. As it was highly successful, these days there are companies which do release dedicated devices to play retro games (ex: [Powkiddy](https://powkiddy.com/),[Anbernic](https://anbernic.com/)).

If you are interested and want something cheap, but fun, I can recommend getting an [R36S](https://handhelds.miraheze.org/wiki/R36S_Handheld_Wiki) device. I bought mine from Aliexpress. **Warnings:** the included SD card is cheap and can break quickly (get a better one + copy content). The R36S is clone of an another device and interistingly this clone has clones which have some extra issues, the [buying guide](https://handhelds.miraheze.org/wiki/R36S_Buying_Guide) helps to avoid getting a clone clone.


The [SBCGaming](https://old.reddit.com/r/SBCGaming/) Reddit community has a ton more info once you got into the topic.
